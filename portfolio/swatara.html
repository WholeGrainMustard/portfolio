                    "This project was one of passion for me. I had previously worked at Camp Swatara as a summer camp
                    councilor multiple summers and have many great memories there. I created this 3D map and
                    construction worksheet in May of 2020, just as I was graduating college and trying to figure out
                    what was next during the pandemic. I took the approximate boundaries of the camp property, squared
                    them off, and used a trail map created by the camp, road data from USDOT, and the 100ft contours
                    from the USGS for the area to create 9 maps that could be colored, cut out, and glued to cardboard
                    to create a 3D relief map of the area. The arch on the back represents the very similar arch you
                    drive through as you first enter the camp. I shared this project with Camp Swatara, and they shared
                    the worksheet <a

                        target="_blank">on Facebook</a>, allowing people to build their own little model of camp while
                    the season had to be cancelled that summer."
