                    "This project looks at demographic data for different cities and counties across Virginia to think
                    about the wide variety of places, people, and outcomes across the commonwealth. It uses data from
                    the 2019 American Community Survey One Year Estimates. Each map shows the topic with all available
                    counties, and then focuses in on four geographies in particular. Rockingham County is a relatively
                    rural county in the Shenandoah Vally in western Virginia. Its economy is still firmly based on
                    agriculture. Henrico County and Richmond City are the state capital and the surround suburban
                    county. This inset often shows the difference between living in the City of Richmond as opposed to
                    its suburbs. Loudon County is an urban/suburban county in northern Virginia. Its economy highly
                    connected to Washington, DC, the federal government, and consulting. Montgomery County is in
                    southwest Virginia and is dominated by Virginia Tech and its students. The hillshade is a
                    georeferenced version of a hand-drawn hillshade made by Richard Edes Harrison."
